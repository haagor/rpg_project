# rpg_project

In this project, I want to create a world where I could develop some IA, and make some behavior and strategic experience. But this kind development  will, without surprise, give me envy to create a small RPG and control a character in this world.

I want to some cities, farms, industries. Implement factions, hikers, ground vehicles and air ships. And build some rules and behaviors to put in movement this small world. But also random events.

Game like Battle Brothers or WarTales give me some ideas to implement commercial system and how to move on the terrain.

Dune spice wars are a fabulous example of beautiful visual.

But in this project I really want to be autonomous as possible. So it's a good occasion to open for the first time Blender. The tutorials that I find, like : [Polygon Runway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdBUYZHJh30&t=5s) are really motivate! So I want to try to make some simple modeling; cities, air ships...

<h2>ToDo</h2>

- Implement NPC, with a id, a vehicle or not, inventory... object programming time!
- Blender time! try to create a VCS or small bunker.
- Behavior for NPC. Transport supplies to cities.
